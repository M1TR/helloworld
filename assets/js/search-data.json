            "content": "from fastai.vision.all import * . Single-label classification . Cats v Dogs . We will use the Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset which contains images of cats and dogs of 37 different breeds. We first build a basic cats-vs-dogs classifier and later we will build a model that can distinguish different breeds. . path = untar_data(URLs.PETS) . path.ls() . (#3) [Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/annotations&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/models&#39;)] . Ignoring the annotations folder for now, we use a helper function called get_image_files which allows us to grab all image files from a folder (recursively). get_image_files returns a list (actually it is an L object from the fastai foundations library) containing the paths to the individual images. . files = get_image_files(path/&quot;images&quot;) . files . (#7390) [Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/american_bulldog_56.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/Siamese_61.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/english_cocker_spaniel_66.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/shiba_inu_55.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/scottish_terrier_68.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/Abyssinian_153.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/Ragdoll_57.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/pug_182.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/Siamese_182.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;/root/.fastai/data/oxford-iiit-pet/images/newfoundland_100.jpg&#39;)...] . The dataset follows a naming convention where the filenames for cat images begins with an uppercase letter whereas those for dog images are entirely in lowercase. We can write a quick function that performs this distinction automatically. . def label_func(f): return &quot;cat&quot; if f[0].isupper() else &quot;dog&quot; . Now we create a DataLoaders object. . Resizing is necessary at this stage since all images in a batch must be of same size to create our stack of tensors. . The from_name_func factory method expects a function to generate labels from filenames. . dls1 = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(path, files, label_func, item_tfms=Resize(224)) . To verify if our dataloader has been created correctly, we use show_batch to return a batch of files and labels. . dls1.show_batch() . Now we create a Learner object which combines the data and the model for training. We use the cnn_learner factory method for convenience. . First we download a model called ResNet34, which has been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tune it on our dataset for one epoch. . learn1 = cnn_learner(dls1, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) . learn1.fine_tune(1) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 0.124347 | 0.026016 | 0.004736 | 00:24 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 0.050945 | 0.019563 | 0.003383 | 00:30 | . We can now use the same Learner object for inference as well. . learn1.predict(files[0]), learn1.predict(files[7000]) . ((&#39;dog&#39;, tensor(1), tensor([2.1911e-05, 9.9998e-01])), (&#39;cat&#39;, tensor(0), tensor([1.0000e+00, 8.0579e-15]))) . predict returns the decoded prediction (dog or cat), the index of the predicted class (0 for cat, 1 for dog), and the probabilities of all the classes; here we can see that our model is quite confident of its predictions as it returns 1 for the predicted class. . Like with show_batch for the dataloader, we can use show_results on the learner to see a batch of images and the corresponding predictions. . learn1.show_results() . fastai also provides tools to interpret the model. See how we can find out those images for which the model made wrong predictions. . interp1 = Interpretation.from_learner(learn1) . interp1.plot_top_losses(12, figsize=(15,11)) . Classifying Animal Breeds . To generate labels with the name of the breed, we&#39;ll need to extract it from the filename. Regex will do the trick. . files[0].name . &#39;american_bulldog_56.jpg&#39; . pat = r&#39;^(.*)_ d+.jpg&#39; . Now we create the dataloader just like before, but we use the from_name_re factory method which expects a regex query to generate labels. . Also, we will use data augmentation to increase model performance without requiring additional data. Note that we use presizing to maintain image quality while augmenting. . dls2 = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_re(path, files, pat, item_tfms=Resize(460), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224)) . As earlier, we use show_batch to see if our labels match our data like we expect it to. . dls2.show_batch() . Now we create our learner as before and train our model. . learn2 = cnn_learner(dls2, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) . learn2.lr . 0.001 . We&#39;ve been using the default hyperparameters till now. Let&#39;s use the learning rate finder to find the most optimal value for the LR. The valley algorithm tends to, in general, provide good values. . lr = learn2.lr_find() . learn2.fine_tune(4, lr.valley) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 1.748438 | 0.365730 | 0.115020 | 00:28 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 0.480563 | 0.298018 | 0.101489 | 00:34 | . 1 | 0.376828 | 0.272560 | 0.087280 | 00:34 | . 2 | 0.257416 | 0.226261 | 0.076455 | 00:34 | . 3 | 0.161659 | 0.213753 | 0.071719 | 00:34 | . learn2.show_results() . We can also use Interpretation to find the images for which the model made bad predictions. . interp2 = Interpretation.from_learner(learn2) . interp2.plot_top_losses(9, figsize=(15,10)) .

            "title": "My Fast.ai Journey - Learning the Basics",
            "content": "In this post, we&#39;ll look at the basic theory of machine learning and define a glossary of machine learning jargon. . Machine Learning . Let&#39;s start at the beginning, with the definition of machine learning, coined by an IBM researcher named Arthur Samuel. In his classic 1962 essay Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation1, he described the basic idea that instead of programming a computer with the exact steps to complete a certain task, showing the computer examples of completed tasks will allow it to figure out how to get there on its own! In essence, the computer itself defines the steps it needs to take to transform the inputs into desired outputs; it writes its own program. . Samuels specified the basic idea of a training loop where a system is configured with a set of parameters and we have some way of testing the effectiveness of this configuration by observing the output of the system. We also need a way of automatically tweaking or tuning these parameters so that the output of the system keep improving. This, essentially, is a method using which a system can learn how to perform a task without any explicit instructions or programming. The system starts out with a random transformation and incrementally improves it to be able to transform the inputs into correct outputs. . Today, the following process forms the heart of any machine learning algorithm: . &lt; insert image A &gt; . The training loop The functional form or structure of our transformation is called the architecture, it&#39;s a program, a mathematical function that converts our inputs into some output. | The architecture has tunable knobs called parameters that change the way it processes inputs. Weights are a kind of parameter. | The architecture and parameters together comprise the model. | The output of the model are its predictions, which are calculated from the independent variables, which is the data without the labels. | The measure of a model&#39;s performance is called the loss. The lower the loss, the better. | The loss depends on both the predictions and the labels (also known as targets or dependent variables). | The process of updating the parameters based on the loss is called training. | . When we are happy with our model&#39;s predictions or the loss value is sufficiently low, our training is complete. We then stop updating the parameters and calculating the loss and instead use the predictions directly; this is called inference and is what happens in production. . Neural Networks . Now that we have an idea about how to design a system which can &quot;learn&quot;, or improve its performance, on its own, it&#39;s time to see how exactly the system transforms inputs into outputs; essentially, we want to learn more about the architecture block. We want a mathematical function that is so flexible that it can, in theory, learn to transform any artitrary input into any arbitrary output. As it turns out, such a function does exist; it&#39;s called a neural network. . In the influential two volume Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition by David Rumelhart, James McClellan, and the PDP Research Group, published in 1986, a &quot;computational framework for modelling cognitive processes&quot; was introduced, inspired by the way neurons in organic brains operate. The idea here is that since traditional computer programs do not operate the way brains do, they also fail at tasks which are easy for the latter, such as recognising objects in pictures. PDP did not invent neural networks, but their approach laid the foundations that led to modern neural networks. . 2According to PDP, to achieve &quot;parallel distributed processing&quot;, you need: . A set of processing units which accept inputs, or neurons | A state of activation for each unit | An output function for each unit | A pattern of connectivity among units, i.e. a network between the units | A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities throughout the network | An activation rule for combining the inputs to a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output | A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity can be modified over time | An environment within which the system operates | &lt; insert image of neurons, neural networks &gt; . And so a neural network is defined: a network of neurons that can take inputs and produce outputs. The behaviour of the network can be modified or tuned by modifying its parameters. Most modern neural networks are multi-layered, meaning that the outputs of a set of neurons are used as inputs for another set of neurons. According to a mathematical proof called the Universal Approximation Theorem, a neural network is flexible enough to model any arbitrary mathematical function. . Let&#39;s refer back to our training loop: . &lt; insert image A &gt; . Now that we have our &quot;architecture&quot; in place, we need a general way to update the parameters of the network, i.e. optimise it. Fortunately, we have a process for this as well, the most fundamental of which is called stochastic gradient descent or SGD. We use SGD to optimise our network based on the loss of the network. The loss, computed by a loss function is a measure of how far off the output of the network was from the correct response; the lower the loss, the better our network performs. . And that&#39;s all there is to it: a neural network, an optimiser, and a loss function. Given enough data, this combination can learn to solve almost any task you provide. .

It took me some time, what with working full time and the numerous psychological setbacks that come with being confined to one&#39;s house as less fortunate people bear the brunt of a global pandemic, but I persevered. Another major goal I had was to document my learning journey and start a blog. I haven&#39;t really spared much thought towards the intent of the blog or its audience but for now, I&#39;m going to simply prepare a basic (read: beginner-level) reference guide to the Fast.ai library and how to perform some common machine learning usecases using it. . I&#39;ll write additional articles as I dive deeper into Fast.ai and machine learning in general but if you are an advanced practitioner, expect this series to be pretty boring! However, if you have constructive criticism, I&#39;m always happy to hear it. . Once I complete this series of articles, my plan is to start working on projects. I am not planning on deriving state-of-the-art results or tackling global warming, but build something fun and interesting which will give me an excuse to write code everyday and sharpen my Google-fu skills! . Right now, I have two projects in mind: . Battery Health Prediction using NASA PCoE Battery Data | Novel Bengali Poetry (i.e. pick-up lines) Generator using Free Bengali Poetry dataset by Ritobrata Ghosh | . When (and if) inspiration strikes, I&#39;ll add other potential project ideas here. I might decide to look into some medical usecases like radiography or blood film analysis later on. .
