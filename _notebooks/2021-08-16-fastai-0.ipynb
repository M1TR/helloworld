    "I've done it! I've finally completed Part 1 of the Fast.ai course. It took me some time, what with working full time and the numerous psychological setbacks that come with being confined to one's house as less fortunate people bear the brunt of aa global pandemic, but I persevered. Another major goal I had was to document my learning journey and start a blog. I haven't really spared much thought towards the intent of the blog or its audience but for now, I'm going to simply prepare a basic (read: beginner-level) reference guide to the Fast.ai library and how to perform some common machine learning usecases using it."
